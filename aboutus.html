      <p>The New Zealand Warriors are a professional rugby league football club based in Auckland, New Zealand that competes in the National Rugby League (NRL) premiership and is the League's only team from outside Australia. They were formed in 1995 as the Auckland Warriors, and are officially known as the Vodafone Warriors for sponsorship reasons. The Warriors are coached by Nathan Brown and captained by Roger Tuivasa-Sheck. They are based at Mt Smart Stadium in the Auckland suburb of Penrose.
<p>For the 1995 season the newly formed Auckland Warriors became the first club from outside Australia to be admitted to the Australian Rugby League's premiership when it expanded from 16 to 20 teams. As a result of the Super League war in the mid-1990s, Auckland left the ARL to compete in the Super League competition of 1997, before joining the re-unified NRL the following year. They re-branded themselves the New Zealand Warriors in 2001. The club has yet to win a premiership as of 2020, but has won one minor premiership (in 2002), reached two grand finals (2002, 2011), reached the play-offs eight times, and have never won the wooden spoon.</p>

<p> A total of 25 players have captained the Warriors in their 26-season existence, including 11 fulltime skippers – each who, for better or worse, added to the fascinating tapestry of the club’s history during their time in charge.</p>
